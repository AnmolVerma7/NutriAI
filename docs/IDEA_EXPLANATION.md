## 1. The Business Problem & Opportunity

**The Challenge:**
Achieving health and fitness goals is notoriously difficult. While 70% of Americans want to eat healthier, most fail because:

1.  **Tracking is Tedious:** Manual calorie counting is time-consuming and prone to error.
2.  **Decision Fatigue:** Deciding what to eat 3 times a day (21 times a week) that fits specific macro goals is mentally exhausting.
3.  **Lack of Personalization:** Generic meal plans don't account for individual dietary needs (Keto, Vegan, Allergies) or daily fluctuations in hunger and activity.

**The Opportunity:**
The health and wellness app market is valued at over $4 billion. Users are moving away from passive tracking apps (like MyFitnessPal) toward **active, intelligent coaching**. There is a massive gap for a solution that doesn't just _record_ what you ate, but _tells you what to eat next_ based on your real-time data.

## 2. Overview of the AI Solution

NutriAI is not just a calorie counter; it is an agentic AI system that actively manages your nutrition.

- **Intelligent Logging:** Users can log meals using natural language (e.g., "I had a chicken burrito and a coke"). Segmented AI agents analyze this input to extract precise nutritional data.
- **Context-Aware Meal Planning:** The core innovation is our **Multi-Agent Planner**. It doesn't give static advice. It looks at:
  - What you've already eaten today.
  - Your remaining calorie/macro budget.
  - Your specific diet (e.g., Keto, Vegan).
- **Real-Time Adaptation:** If you overeat at lunch, NutriAI doesn't shame you. It dynamically recalculates and suggests a lighter, protein-rich dinner to keep you on track for the day.

## 4. Preliminary Market Research

- **Growing Demand:** The global fitness app market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 17.6% from 2024 to 2030.
- **Competitor Analysis:**
  - _MyFitnessPal:_ Great data, but passive and manual.
  - _Noom:_ Good psychology, but expensive ($60/mo) and human-reliant.
  - _NutriAI:_ Bridges the gap by offering active coaching at a lower cost using scalable AI agents.
- **Feasibility:** By leveraging robust APIs (Spoonacular, Nutritionix) and advanced LLMs (Claude 3.5), we can deliver high-quality, personalized nutrition advice at a fraction of the cost of a human nutritionist.
