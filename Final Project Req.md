# 🚀 Final Project: Build a Production-Grade AI Product

## 🎯 Your Mission

Design, develop, and present a **complete AI-powered solution** that tackles a real business challenge. This project simulates building an early-stage AI startup product, integrating:

- Modern AI technologies
- Real-world data sources
- Software engineering best practices
- User-centered design
- Business strategy & value creation

---

## 👥 Team Structure

**You may work:**

- **Solo**, or
- **In pairs (max 2 people)**

**If working in pairs:**

- Expectations are **significantly higher** for quality, features, and technical depth
- Both members must contribute to ALL parts (technical, UI, business, presentation)
- Must submit [Group Contribution Table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MYJ-tqNVcSbIS2Q_hg9-1TYA_E_POKTVP9l8VqhpDHI/edit?usp=sharing)

---

## ✅ Quick Checklist: Every Project Must Have

- [ ] User Authentication (Supabase Auth recommended)
- [ ] Deployed UI on Vercel/Cloudflare (Next.js strongly recommended)
- [ ] Agentic Workflow: 4+ agents, 2+ conditional branches
- [ ] Real Data Integration (API or web scraping)
- [ ] Polished, Production-Ready Design

---

## 📋 Mandatory Requirements

### 1️⃣ Authentication **[REQUIRED]**

Real user authentication to make your app behave like an actual SaaS product.

**Recommended:** Supabase Auth (email/password or OAuth)

---

### 2️⃣ Modern Deployed UI **[REQUIRED]**

A fully designed, polished interface that feels like an actual product, not a prototype.

**Requirements:**

- Deploy on **Vercel** (recommended) or **Cloudflare Pages**
- Tech stack: **Next.js** strongly recommended
  - Other frameworks allowed only if equal quality can be delivered
- Must include real content, images, icons, branding
- No placeholders or half-finished pages

---

### 3️⃣ Sophisticated Agentic Workflow **[REQUIRED]**

An AI workflow, not a simple chatbot. This course is beyond basic prompting.

**Must include:**

- At least **4 separate AI agents** with clear roles
- At least **2 conditional branches**
- Use of tools or external data sources
- Orchestration via Flowise, LangChain, LlamaIndex, or custom code

**✅ Acceptable Examples:**

- Travel planner that branches based on budget AND location preferences
- Financial advisor consulting market data AND risk profile branches
- Content strategy agent using scraping + persona analysis + multi-agent generation

**❌ Unacceptable Examples:**

- Single chatbot with an "improved prompt"
- "Sassy assistant" that just alters tone
- Linear GPT call with no branching or external data

---

### 4️⃣ Real Data Integration **[REQUIRED]**

Fetch data from an API or scrape data. Your AI must use this data meaningfully.

**Data Source Options:**

- Yahoo Finance → stock data
- TMDB → movies
- YouTube API → videos
- Spotify, Books API, Reddit, Weather APIs
- Scraping: jobs, housing, products, reviews

---

### 5️⃣ Polished Product **[REQUIRED]**

Your app must reflect an actually usable product experience.

**Requirements:**

- Visually complete and professional
- Real content, images, icons, examples, branding
- No placeholders anywhere
- Use AI to generate filler content and visuals as needed

---

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Idea Explanation (1 Page)

A clear and professional one-page document including:

- The business problem or opportunity
- Project name, logo, color palette, and basic brand identity
- Overview of your AI solution
- Why this solution is valuable or commercially viable
- Preliminary research supporting market demand or feasibility

---

### 2. Presentation Deck (6 Slides + Demo)

Your deck must include:

1. **Slide 1:** The business problem or opportunity

---

### 3. Working Prototype (Core Deliverable)

An MVP you could pitch to investors:

- Deployed and accessible to testers
- Full authentication
- Modern, polished UI
- Agentic workflow (4 agents, 2 conditionals)

## 💡 The Bottom Line

**This is no longer a "school project."**  
**This is your first real AI startup prototype.**

Every project must include:

- ✓ Authentication
- ✓ Next.js deployed UI
- ✓ Agentic workflow
- ✓ External data
- ✓ Business reasoning
